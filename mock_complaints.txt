Concurrently the engine like came on and multiple warning signals came on regarding traction control, breaking, and steering. One can imagine how unsettling that could be but at that moment. Being in the left lane it was apparent I needed to get off the road.  With cars traveling at 65+ mph and my car decelerating continuously changing lanes was nearly catastrophic and the last lane I needed to move over to nearly resulted in a multi car accident 11/8/2021 I was contacted by the service manager at the towed to acura dealer. They informed me that the evaluation determined a need for an \u201cintercooler\" This breakdown of my car with less than 20,000 miles on it was under warranty . More importantly, my understanding of this problem is that the car is engineered to power down under these circumstances to protect the engine and or transmission. I would have imagined that when a warning like comes on it would not result in an instantaneous power down action. Put quite simply it appears the car was more interested in protecting itself than the occupants. This is egregious. Acura has failed to address my concern or help now about 1 month out","products":[{"type":"Vehicle","productYear":"2020","productMake":"ACURA","productModel":"RDX","manufacturer":"Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)"}]},{"odiNumber":11439887,"manufacturer":"Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)","crash":false,"fire":false,"numberOfInjuries":0,"numberOfDeaths":0,"dateOfIncident":"10/28/2021","dateComplaintFiled":"11/09/2021","vin":"5J8TC2H70LL","components":"VEHICLE SPEED CONTROL,ENGINE","summary":"Last week I was driving the 2020 Acura RDX on the Massachusetts Turnpike during very wet weather.  Three hours into a planned four hour drive, while accelerating up a hill, the car power cut out.  Engine was running, but no oomph.  Check engine light, and other lights, flashing on dashboard.  Car kept slowing, and there was no place to pull over at that point on the pike (mile 68).  Finally, car made it to crest of hill (at that point going 15 miles an hour in the right hand lane and still slowing), and a pull out spot appeared.  Pulled over, but a very harrowing experience.    Had the car towed to the closest Acura dealer (this was clearly an issue that would be covered by warranty...).  They checked out car, and said that they had seen the same problem before, and that fix was to replace the \"intercooler kit\", which required a part that was on a long back order.  Researching other threads, I find that this has happened to others... and that a \"fix\" can be to turn off the car, and restart after a few minutes.  Car seems to drive fine again...  In any case, I later moved the car to the dealer where we bought it, and they had the part in stock.  Apparently, when it is very wet and a driver accelerates hard, the old part lets some water enter the turbo charger, at which point the car goes into \"limp\" mode.  Apparently, Acura has an outstanding service bulletin on this issue.  The reason for my filing... I think that this a recall issue.  I love the car, and am glad that it is fixed (at least, I hope it is!), but this is a very bad problem and should not happen.  Any questions, please let me know.  But I would encourage Acura to do a formal recall...","products":[{"type":"Vehicle","productYear":"2020","productMake":"ACURA","productModel":"RDX","manufacturer":"Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)"}]},{"odiNumber":11437457,"manufacturer":"Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)","crash":false,"fire":false,"numberOfInjuries":0,"numberOfDeaths":0,"dateOfIncident":"10/05/2021","dateComplaintFiled":"10/20/2021","vin":"5j8tc2h71ll","components":"POWER TRAIN","summary":"Pulled out to pass and when I tried to accelerate, the engine basically died.

Acura is aware of the problem and says it is a design flaw with the turbo intercooler, but they don't have parts to fix it. They said pulling over and turning the car off for a minute and restarting it should fix the problem, which it did for me, but that isn't always safe to do. Acura also said it is out of warranty and I will have to pay for the repair out of pocket.

THE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE WHEN APPLYING MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR. FORTUNATELY THERE WAS STILL ENOUGH FORWARD MOTION IN THE CAR FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE WITHOUT INCIDENT. AFTER A FEW SECONDS, I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR AGAIN AND THE CAR HAD RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATION.  I BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE. THEY COULD NOT FIND OR DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM RELATED TO MY EXPERIENCES. I GAVE THEM COPIES OF MY INTERNET SEARCHES SHOWING OTHER DRIVERS' COMPLAINTS HAVING SIMILAR \"LIMP MODE\" EXPERIENCES. THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND OF ANY COMPLAINTS. I FIND THIS RESPONSE ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE AT STAKE. FOR NOW, I AM LIMITING MY DRIVING TO WHAT IS ONLY NECESSARY UNTIL THIS DEFECT IS RESOLVED. I AM ALSO CONSIDERING OTHER OPTIONS.","products":[{"type":"Vehicle","productYear":"2020","productMake":"ACURA","productModel":"RDX","manufacturer":"Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)"}]},{"odiNumber":11301394,"manufacturer":"Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)","crash":false,"fire":false,"numberOfInjuries":0,"numberOfDeaths":0,"dateOfIncident":"11/11/2019","dateComplaintFiled":"01/23/2020","vin":"5J8TC2H53LL","components":"SUSPENSION","summary":"ON OCTOBER 30, 2020 I LEASED A 2020 ACURA RDX (AWD TECH) FROM SPRINGFIELD ACURA, 243 ROUTE 22 E, SPRINGFIELD, NJ 07081.

NOW, HOWEVER, I'M FEELING SAD AND DISILLUSIONED, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I DON'T FEEL 100% SAFE DRIVING IT. RECENTLY, AFTER SPENDING A FEW WEEKS IN GEORGIA, WE WERE DRIVING BACK HOME TO NORTHERN VIRGINIA ON I-85N IN NORTH CAROLINA.  IT WAS AND HAD BEEN RAINING STEADILY THE ENTIRE TRIP.  THERE WAS MODERATE/HEAVY TRAFFIC MOVING AT SPEEDS BETWEEN 60-75/80 MPH. SOMEWHERE JUST SOUTH OF CHARLOTTE, THE CAR SUDDENLY STARTED SLOWING DOWN, EVEN THOUGH I WAS PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR!  IT WAS BARELY MOVING IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS BLINKING AND THE ENGINE WAS RATTLING AND SPUTTERING.  I IMMEDIATELY TURNED ON THE HAZARDS AND STARTED CROSSING THE TWO FAR RIGHT LANES TO GET OVER TO THE NARROW SHOULDER.  TERRIFYING.      FORTUNATELY, WE WERE ONLY ABOUT A 1/4 MILE FROM AN EXIT.  WE SLOWLY MADE IT ON THE SHOULDER TO ONE OF GAS STATIONS THERE.  AFTER CHECKING THE SUPPORT SECTION IN THE APP AND CALLING A TECH AT MY HOME DEALERSHIP, I SHUT THE CAR OFF AND LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES.  IT STARTED AND WE WERE ABLE TO FINISH THE TRIP WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.    WE MADE IT HOME SAFELY, BUT THE REMAINING SIX HOURS OF THE TRIP WERE MENTALLY EXCRUCIATING.  WE DROVE AS SLOWLY AS SAFELY POSSIBLE IN THE RIGHT LANE.  I COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD THAT IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN AT ANY MOMENT.  AND, I CAN'T SAY IT HASN'T CROSSED MY MIND THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OVER THAT EXTENDED FEELING OF UNCERTAINTY WHILE DRIVING IT.  AT LEAST, NOT FOR NOW.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER ON 11/25/19.  THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE ISSUE, AND THAT THERE WERE NEITHER ERROR NOR FAULT CODES STORED.  I HAD BEEN HOPING THEY WOULD GIVE ME SOME EXPLANATION AND REASSURANCE THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE.
